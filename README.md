## Description

This project was made to be a portfolio to showcase my work as a web developer. 

### Lessons and Challenges

I'm not really that happy with the way this portfolio looks. While making this portfolio I had an idea for a new portfolio that will look more modern and eye catching, but will take some time to make. I'm stuck trying to decide if I should remake it or leave it the way it is in hopes that its good enough to land me a job.
